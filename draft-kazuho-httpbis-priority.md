--- abstract

This document describes a scheme for prioritizing HTTP responses. This scheme
expresses the priority of each HTTP response using absolute values, rather than
as a relative relationship between a group of HTTP responses.

This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial
priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
frames for reprioritizing the responses. These share a common format structure
that is designed to provide future extensibility.

# Introduction

It is common for an HTTP ({{!RFC7230}}) resource representation to have
relationships to one or more other resources.  Clients will often discover these
relationships while processing a retrieved representation, leading to further
retrieval requests.  Meanwhile, the nature of the relationship determines
whether the client is blocked from continuing to process locally available
resources.  For example, visual rendering of an HTML document could be blocked
by the retrieval of a CSS file that the document refers to.  In contrast, inline
images do not block rendering and get drawn incrementally as the chunks of the
images arrive.

To provide meaningful representation of a document at the earliest moment, it is
important for an HTTP server to prioritize the HTTP responses, or the chunks of
those HTTP responses, that it sends.

HTTP/2 ({{?RFC7540}}) provides such a prioritization scheme. A client sends a
series of PRIORITY frames to communicate to the server a “priority tree”; this
represents the client's preferred ordering and weighted distribution of the
bandwidth among the HTTP responses. However, the design and implementation of
this scheme has been observed to have shortcomings, explained in {{motivation}}.

This document defines the Priority HTTP header field that can be used by both
client and server to specify the precedence of HTTP responses in a standardized,
extensible, protocol-version-independent, end-to-end format. Along with the
protocol-version-specific frame for reprioritization, this prioritization scheme
acts as a substitute for the original prioritization scheme of HTTP/2.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

The terms sh-token and sh-boolean are imported from
{{!STRUCTURED-HEADERS=I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}.

Example HTTP requests and responses use the HTTP/2-style formatting from
{{?RFC7540}}.

This document uses the variable-length integer encoding from
{{!I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}.


# Motivation for Replacing HTTP/2 Priorities {#motivation}

An important feature of any implementation of a protocol that provides
multiplexing is the ability to prioritize the sending of information. This was
an important realization in the design of HTTP/2. Prioritization is a
difficult problem, so it will always be suboptimal, particularly if one endpoint
operates in ignorance of the needs of its peer.

HTTP/2 introduced a complex prioritization signaling scheme that used a
combination of dependencies and weights, formed into an unbalanced tree. This
scheme has suffered from poor deployment and interoperability.

The rich flexibility of client-driven HTTP/2 prioritization tree building is
rarely exercised; experience shows that clients either choose a single model
optimized for a web use case (and don't vary it) or do nothing at all. But every
client builds their prioritization tree in a different way, which makes it
difficult for servers to understand their intent and act or intervene
accordingly.

Many HTTP/2 server implementations do not include support for the priority
scheme, some favoring instead bespoke server-driven schemes based on heuristics
and other hints, like the content type of resources and the order in which
requests arrive. For example, a server, with knowledge of the document
structure, might want to prioritize the delivery of images that are critical to
user experience above other images, but below the CSS files. Since client trees
vary, it is impossible for the server to determine how such images should be
prioritized against other responses.

The HTTP/2 scheme allows intermediaries to coalesce multiple client trees into a
single tree that is used for a single upstream HTTP/2 connection. However, most
intermediaries do not support this. The scheme does not define a method that can
be used by a server to express the priority of a response. Without such a
method, intermediaries cannot coordinate client-driven and server-driven
priorities.

HTTP/2 describes denial-of-service considerations for implementations. On
2019-08-13 Netflix issued an advisory notice about the discovery of several
resource exhaustion vectors affecting multiple HTTP/2 implementations. One
attack, CVE-2019-9513 aka "Resource Loop", is based on manipulation of the
priority tree.

The HTTP/2 scheme depends on in-order delivery of signals, leading to challenges
in porting the scheme to protocols that do not provide global ordering. For
example, the scheme cannot be used in HTTP/3 {{?I-D.ietf-quic-http}} without
changing the signal and its processing.

Considering the problems with deployment and adaptability to HTTP/3, retaining
the HTTP/2 priority scheme increases the complexity of the entire system without
any evidence that the value it provides offsets that complexity. In fact,
multiple experiments from independent research have shown that simpler schemes
can reach at least equivalent performance characteristics compared to the more
complex HTTP/2 setups seen in practice, at least for the web use case.

## Disabling HTTP/2 Priorities

The problems and insights set out above are motivation for allowing endpoints to
opt out of using the HTTP/2 priority scheme, in favor of using an alternative
such as the scheme defined in this specification. The
SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_HTTP2_PRIORITIES setting described below enables endpoints to
understand their peer's intention. The value of the parameter MUST
be 0 or 1. Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error
(see {{!RFC7540}}; Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

Endpoints MUST send this SETTINGS parameter as part of the first SETTINGS frame.
When the peer receives the first SETTINGS frame, it learns the sender has
deprecated the HTTP/2 priority scheme if it receives the
SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_HTTP2_PRIORITIES parameter with the value of 1.

A sender MUST NOT change the SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_HTTP2_PRIORITIES parameter value
after the first SETTINGS frame. Detection of a change by a receiver MUST be
treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

Until the client receives the SETTINGS frame from the server, the client SHOULD
send both the priority signal defined in the HTTP/2 priority scheme and also
that of this prioritization scheme. Once the client learns that the HTTP/2
priority scheme is deprecated, it SHOULD stop sending the HTTP/2 priority
signals. If the client learns that the HTTP/2 priority scheme is not
deprecated, it SHOULD stop sending PRIORITY_UPDATE frames, but MAY continue
sending the Priority header field, as it is an end-to-end signal that might be
useful to nodes behind the server that the client is directly connected to.

The SETTINGS frame precedes any priority signal sent from a client in HTTP/2,
so a server can determine if it should respect the HTTP/2 scheme before
building state.

# Priority Parameters

The priority information is a sequence of key-value pairs, providing room for
future extensions. Each key-value pair represents a priority parameter.

The Priority HTTP header field is an end-to-end way to transmit this set of
parameters when a request or a response is issued. In order to reprioritize a
request, HTTP-version-specific frames are used by clients to transmit the
same information on a single hop.  If intermediaries want to specify
prioritizaton on a multiplexed HTTP connection, it SHOULD use a
PRIORITY_UPDATE frame and SHOULD NOT change the Priority header field.

In both cases, the set of priority parameters is encoded as a Structured Headers
Dictionary ({{!STRUCTURED-HEADERS}}).

This document defines the urgency(`u`) and incremental(`i`) parameters. When
used, these parameters MUST be accompanied by values. When any of the defined
parameters are omitted, or if the Priority header field is not used, their
default values SHOULD be applied.

Unknown parameters, parameters with out-of-range values or values of unexpected
types MUST be ignored.

## urgency

The urgency(`u`) parameter takes an integer between 0 and 7, in descending order of
priority, as shown below:

| Urgency         | Definition                        |
|----------------:|:----------------------------------|
|               0 | prerequisite ({{prerequisite}})   |
|               1 | default ({{default}})             |
| between 2 and 6 | supplementary ({{supplementary}}) |
|               7 | background ({{background}})       |
{: #urgencies title="Urgencies"}

The value is encoded as an sh-integer. The default value is 1.

A server SHOULD transmit HTTP responses in the order of their urgency values.
The lower the value, the higher the precedence.

The following example shows a request for a CSS file with the urgency set to
`0`:

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /style.css
priority = u=0
~~~

The definition of the urgencies and their expected use-case are described below.
Endpoints SHOULD respect the definition of the values when assigning urgencies.

### prerequisite

The prerequisite urgency (value 0) indicates that the response prevents other
responses with an urgency of prerequisite or default from being used until it
is fully transmitted.

For example, use of an external stylesheet can block a web browser from
rendering the HTML. In such case, the stylesheet is given the prerequisite
urgency.

### default

The default urgency (value 1) indicates a response that is to be used as it is
delivered to the client, but one that does not block other responses from being
used.

For example, when a user using a web browser navigates to a new HTML document,
the request for that HTML is given the default urgency.  When that HTML document
uses a custom font, the request for that custom font SHOULD also be given the
default urgency.  This is because the availability of the custom font is likely
a precondition for the user to use that portion of the HTML document, which is
to be rendered by that font.

### supplementary

The supplementary urgencies (values 2 to 6) indicate a response that is helpful
to the client using a composition of responses, even though the response itself
is not mandatory for using those responses.

For example, inline images (i.e., images being fetched and displayed as part of
the document) are visually important elements of an HTML document.  As such,
users will typically not be prevented from using the document, at least to some
degree, before any or all of these images are loaded. Display of those images
are thus considered to be an improvement for visual clients rather than a
prerequisite for all user agents.  Therefore, such images will be given the
supplementary urgency.

Values between 2 and 6 are used to represent this urgency, to provide
flexibility to the endpoints for giving some responses more or less precedence
than others that belong to the supplementary group. {{merging}} explains how
these values might be used.

Clients SHOULD NOT use values 2 and 6.  Servers MAY use these values to
prioritize a response above or below other supplementary responses.

Clients MAY use values 3 to indicate that a request is given relatively high
priority, or 5 to indicate relatively low priority, within the supplementary
urgency group.

For example, an image certain to be visible at the top of the page, might be
assigned a value of 3 instead of 4, as it will have a high visual impact for the
user.  Conversely, an asynchronously loaded JavaScript file might be assigned an
urgency value of 5, as it is less likely to have a visual impact.

When none of the considerations above is applicable, the value of 3 SHOULD be
used.

### background

The background urgency (value 7) is used for responses of which the delivery can
be postponed without having an impact on using other responses.

As an example, the download of a large file in a web browser would be assigned
the background urgency so it would not impact further page loads on the same
connection.

## incremental

The incremental(`i`) parameter takes an sh-boolean as the value that indicates if
a response can be processed incrementally, i.e. provide some meaningful output
as chunks of the response arrive.

The default value of the incremental parameter is `0`.

A server SHOULD distribute the bandwidth of a connection between incremental
responses that share the same urgency.

A server SHOULD transmit non-incremental responses one by one, preferably in the
order the requests were generated.  Doing so maximizes the chance of the client
making progress in using the composition of the HTTP responses at the earliest
moment.

The following example shows a request for a JPEG file with the urgency parameter
set to `4` and the incremental parameter set to `1`.

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /image.jpg
priority = u=4, i=?1
~~~

## Defining New Parameters

When attempting to extend priorities, care must be taken to ensure any use of
existing parameters are either unchanged or modified in a way that is backwards
compatible for peers that are unaware of the extended meaning.

# The Priority HTTP Header Field

The Priority HTTP header field can appear in requests and responses. A client
uses it to specify the priority of the response. A server uses it to inform
the client that the priority was overwritten. An intermediary can use the
Priority information from client requests and server responses to correct or
amend the precedence to suit it (see {{merging}}).

The Priority header field is an end-to-end signal of the request priority from
the client or the response priority from the server.

As is the ordinary case for HTTP caching ({{?RFC7234}}), a response with a
Priority header field might be cached and re-used for subsequent requests.
When an origin server generates the Priority response header field based on
properties of an HTTP request it receives, the server is expected to control the
cacheability or the applicability of the cached response, by using header fields
that control the caching behavior (e.g., Cache-Control, Vary).

# Reprioritization

After a client sends a request, it may be beneficial to change the priority of
the response. As an example, a web browser might issue a prefetch request for
a JavaScript file with the urgency parameter of the Priority request header
field set to `u=7` (background). Then, when the user navigates to a page which
references the new JavaScript file, while the prefetch is in progress, the
browser would send a reprioritization frame with the priority field value
set to `u=0` (prerequisite).

In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, after a request message is sent on a stream, the stream
transitions to a state that prevents the client from sending additional
frames on the stream. Therefore, a client cannot reprioritize a response by
using the Priority header field.  Modifying this behavior would require a
semantic change to the protocol, but this is avoided by restricting the
stream on which a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame can be sent. In HTTP/2 the frame
is on stream zero and in HTTP/3 it is sent on the control stream
({{!I-D.ietf-quic-http}}, Section 6.2.1).

This document specifies a new PRIORITY_UPDATE frame type for HTTP/2
({{!RFC7540}}) and HTTP/3 ({{!I-D.ietf-quic-http}}) which enables
reprioritization. It carries updated priority parameters and references the
target of the reprioritization based on a version-specific identifier; in
HTTP/2 this is the Stream ID, in HTTP/3 this is either the Stream ID or Push ID.

Unlike the header field, the reprioritization frame is a hop-by-hop signal.

## HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame

The HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame (type=0xF) carries the stream ID of the
response that is being reprioritized, and the updated priority in ASCII text,
using the same representation as that of the Priority header field value.

The Stream Identifier field ({{!RFC7540}}, Section 4.1) in the PRIORITY_UPDATE
frame header MUST be zero (0x0).

~~~ drawing
  0                   1                   2                   3
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+

 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-h2-reprioritization-frame title="HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame Payload"}

The PRIORITY_UPDATE frame payload has the following fields:

R:
: A reserved 1-bit field. The semantics of this bit are undefined, and the bit
  MUST remain unset (0x0) when sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.

Stream ID:
: A 31-bit stream identifier for the stream that is the target of the priority
  update.

Priority Field Value:
: The priority update value in ASCII text, encoded using Structured Headers.

The HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame MUST NOT be sent prior to opening the
stream.  If a PRIORITY_UPDATE is received prior to the stream being opened,
it MAY be treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

TODO: add more description of how to handle things like receiving
PRIORITY_UPDATE on wrong stream, a PRIORITY_UPDATE with an invalid ID, etc.

## HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame

The HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame (type=0xF) carries the identifier of the
element that is being reprioritized, and the updated priority in ASCII text,
using the same representation as that of the Priority header field value.

The PRIORITY_UPDATE frame MUST be sent on the control stream
({{!I-D.ietf-quic-http}}, Section 6.2.1).

~~~ drawing
  0                   1                   2                   3
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |T|    Empty    |   Prioritized Element ID (i)                ...
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |                   Priority Field Value (*)                  ...
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~
{: #fig-h3-reprioritization-frame title="HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame Payload"}

The PRIORITY_UPDATE frame payload has the following fields:

T (Prioritized Element Type):
: A one-bit field indicating the type of element
being prioritized. A value of 0 indicates a reprioritization for a Request
Stream, so the Prioritized Element ID is interpreted as a Stream ID. A
value of 1 indicates a reprioritization for a Push stream, so the Prioritized
Element ID is interpreted as a Push ID.

Empty:
: A seven-bit field that has no semantic value.

Prioritized Element ID:
: The stream ID or push ID that is the target of the priority update.

Priority Field Value:
: The priority update value in ASCII text, encoded using Structured Headers.

The HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame MUST NOT be sent with an invalid identifier,
including before the request stream has been opened or before a promised
request has been received.  If a server receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE specifying
a push ID that has not been promised, it SHOULD be treated as a connection
error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

Because the HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame is sent on the control stream and
there are no ordering guarantees between streams, a client that reprioritizes
a request before receiving the response data might cause the server to receive
a PRIORITY_UPDATE for an unknown request. If the request stream ID is within
bidirectional stream limits, the PRIORITY_UPDATE frame SHOULD be buffered
until the stream is opened and applied immediately after the request message
has been processed. Holding PRIORITY_UPDATES consumes extra state on the peer,
although the size of the state is bounded by bidirectional stream limits. There
is no bound on the number of PRIORITY_UPDATES that can be sent, so an
endpoint SHOULD store only the most recently received frame.

TODO: add more description of how to handle things like receiving
PRIORITY_UPDATE on wrong stream, a PRIORITY_UPDATE with an invalid ID, etc.

# Merging Client- and Server-Driven Parameters {#merging}

It is not always the case that the client has the best understanding of how the
HTTP responses deserve to be prioritized. For example, use of an HTML document
might depend heavily on one of the inline images. Existence of such
dependencies is typically best known to the server.

By using the "Priority" response header, a server can override the
prioritization hints provided by the client. When used, the parameters found
in the response header field overrides those specified by the client.

For example, when the client sends an HTTP request with

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /menu.png
priority = u=4, i=?1
~~~

and the origin responds with

~~~ example
:status = 200
content-type = image/png
priority = u=2
~~~

the intermediary's understanding of the urgency is promoted from `4` to `2`,
because the server-provided value overrides the value provided by the client.
The incremental value continues to be `1`, the value specified by the client,
as the server did not specify the incremental(`i`) parameter.


# Security Considerations

## Fairness {#fairness}

As a general guideline, a server SHOULD NOT use priority information for making
schedule decisions across multiple connections, unless it knows that those
connections originate from the same client. Due to this, priority information
conveyed over a non-coalesced HTTP connection (e.g., HTTP/1.1) might go unused.

The remainder of this section discusses scenarios where unfairness is
problematic and presents possible mitigations, or where unfairness is desirable.

TODO: Discuss if we should add a signal that mitigates this issue. For example,
we might add a SETTINGS parameter that indicates the next hop that the
connection is NOT coalesced (see https://github.com/kazuho/draft-kazuho-httpbis-priority/issues/99).

### Coalescing Intermediaries

When an intermediary coalesces HTTP requests coming from multiple clients into
one HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connection going to the backend server, requests that
originate from one client might have higher precedence than those coming from
others.

It is sometimes beneficial for the server running behind an intermediary to obey
to the value of the Priority header field. As an example, a resource-constrained
server might defer the transmission of software update files that would have the
background urgency being associated. However, in the worst case, the asymmetry
between the precedence declared by multiple clients might cause responses going
to one end client to be delayed totally after those going to another.

In order to mitigate this fairness problem, when a server responds to a request
that is known to have come through an intermediary, the server SHOULD prioritize
the response as if it was assigned the priority of  `u=1, i=?1`
(i.e. round-robin) regardless of the value of the Priority header field being
transmitted, unless the server knows the intermediary is not
coalescing requests from multiple clients.

A server can determine if a request came from an intermediary through
configuration, or by consulting if that request contains one of the following
header fields:

* CDN-Loop ({{?RFC8586}})
* Forwarded, X-Forwarded-For ({{?RFC7239}})
* Via ({{?RFC7230}}, Section 5.7.1)

Responding to requests coming through an intermediary in a round-robin manner
works well when the network bottleneck exists between the intermediary and the
end client, as the intermediary would be buffering the responses and then be
forwarding the chunks of those buffered responses based on the prioritization
scheme it implements. A sophisticated server MAY use a weighted round-robin
reflecting the urgencies expressed in the requests, so that less urgent
responses would receive less bandwidth in case the bottleneck exists between the
server and the intermediary.

### HTTP/1.x Back Ends

It is common for CDN infrastructure to support different HTTP versions on the
front end and back end. For instance, the client-facing edge might support
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 while communication to back end servers is done using
HTTP/1.1. Unlike with connection coalescing, the CDN will "de-mux" requests into
discrete connections to the back end. As HTTP/1.1 and older do not provide a way
to concurrently transmit multiple responses, there is no immediate fairness
issue in protocol. However, back end servers MAY still use client headers for
request scheduling. Back end servers SHOULD only schedule based on client
priority information where that information can be scoped to individual end
clients. Authentication and other session information might provide this
linkability.

### Intentional Introduction of Unfairness

It is sometimes beneficial to deprioritize the transmission of one connection
over others, knowing that doing so introduces a certain amount of unfairness
between the connections and therefore between the requests served on those
connections.

For example, a server might use a scavenging congestion controller on
connections that only convey background priority responses such as software
update images. Doing so improves responsiveness of other connections at the cost
of delaying the delivery of updates.

Also, a client MAY use the priority values for making local scheduling choices
for the requests it initiates.

# Considerations

## Why use an End-to-End Header Field?

Contrary to the prioritization scheme of HTTP/2 that uses a hop-by-hop frame,
the Priority header field is defined as end-to-end.

The rationale is that the Priority header field transmits how each response
affects the client's processing of those responses, rather than how relatively
urgent each response is to others.  The way a client processes a response is a
property associated to that client generating that request.  Not that of an
intermediary.  Therefore, it is an end-to-end property.  How these end-to-end
properties carried by the Priority header field affect the prioritization
between the responses that share a connection is a hop-by-hop issue.

Having the Priority header field defined as end-to-end is important for caching
intermediaries.  Such intermediaries can cache the value of the Priority header
field along with the response, and utilize the value of the cached header field
when serving the cached response, only because the header field is defined as
end-to-end rather than hop-by-hop.

It should also be noted that the use of a header field carrying a textual value
makes the prioritization scheme extensible; see the discussion below.

## Why do Urgencies Have Meanings?

One of the aims of this specification is to define a mechanism for merging
client- and server-provided hints for prioritizing the responses.  For that to
work, each urgency level needs to have a well-defined meaning.  As an example, a
server can assign the highest precedence among the supplementary responses to an
HTTP response carrying an icon, because the meaning of `u=2` is shared
among the endpoints.

This specification restricts itself to defining a minimum set of urgency levels
in order to provide sufficient granularity for prioritizing responses for
ordinary web browsing, at minimal complexity.

However, that does not mean that the prioritization scheme would forever be
stuck to the eight levels.  The design provides extensibility.  If deemed
necessary, it would be possible to subdivide any of the eight urgency levels
that are currently defined.  Or, a graphical user-agent could send a `visible`
parameter to indicate if the resource being requested is within the viewport.

A server can combine the hints provided in the Priority header field with other
information in order to improve the prioritization of responses.  For example, a
server that receives requests for a font {{?RFC8081}} and images with the same
urgency might give higher precedence to the font, so that a visual client can
render textual information at an early moment.

## Can an Intermediary Send its own Signal?

There might be a benefit in recommending a coalescing intermediary to embed its
own prioritization hints into the HTTP request that it forwards to the backend
server, as otherwise the Priority header field would not be as helpful to the
backend (see {{fairness}}).

One way of achieving that, without dropping the original signal, would be to let
the intermediary express its own signal using the Priority header field, at the
same time transplanting the original value to a different header field.

As an example, when a client sends an HTTP request carrying a priority of
`u=0` and the intermediary wants to instead associate
`u=1; i=?1`, the intermediary would send a HTTP request that
contains the following two header fields to the backend server:

~~~
priority = u=1; i=?1
original-priority = u=0
~~~

# Acknowledgements

Roy Fielding presented the idea of using a header field for representing
priorities in <http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/83/slides/slides-83-httpbis-5.pdf>.
In <https://github.com/pmeenan/http3-prioritization-proposal>, Patrick Meenan
advocates for representing the priorities using a tuple of urgency and
concurrency. The ability to deprecate HTTP/2 priortization is based on
{{?I-D.lassey-priority-setting}}, authored by Brad Lassey and Lucas Pardue, with
modifications based on feedback that was not incorporated into an update to that
document.

The motivation for defining an alternative to HTTP/2 priorities is drawn from
discussion within the broad HTTP community. Special thanks to Roberto Peon,
Martin Thomson and Netflix for text that was incorporated explicitly in this
document.
