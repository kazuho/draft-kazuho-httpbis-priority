1.  Introduction

   It is often the case for the processing of an HTTP response to depend
   on the retrieval of another HTTP response.

   As an example, visual rendering of an HTML document could be blocked
   by the retrieval of a CSS ([RFC2318]) file that the document refers
   to.  Inline images is another example, though the difference is that
   they typically do not block rendering.  Instead, they are rendered
   progressively as the chunks of the images arrive.

   To provide meaningful representation of a document at the earliest
   moment, it is important for a HTTP server to prioritize the HTTP
   responses, or the chunks of those HTTP responses, that it sends.

   HTTP/2 provides such prioritization scheme.  A client sends a series
   of PRIORITY frames to communicate to the server a "priority tree;" a
   tree that represents the client's preferred ordering and weighted
   distribution of the bandwidth among the HTTP responses.  However, the
   design has shortcomings:

   o  Its complexity has led to varying levels of support by the HTTP/2
      client and servers.

   o  It is hard for the server to customize prioritization.  For
      example, a server, with the knowledge of the document structure,
      might want to prioritize the delivery of images that are critical
      to user experience above others images, but below the CSS files.
      But with the HTTP/2 prioritization scheme, it is impossible for
      the server to determine how such images should be prioritized
      against other responses that use client-driven prioritization

      tree, because every client builds the HTTP/2 prioritization tree
      in a different way.

   o  The design cannot be ported cleanly to HTTP/3.  One of the primary
      goals of HTTP/3 is to minimize head-of-line blocking.
      Transmitting the evolving representation of a "prioritization
      tree" from the client to the server requires head-of-line
      blocking.

   Based on these observations, this document defines the Priority HTTP
   header field that can be used to specify the precedence of each HTTP
   response in a standardized, extensible, protocol-version-independent,
   end-to-end representation.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Priority HTTP Header Field

   The Priority HTTP header field is used by a client as part of an HTTP
   request to specify the priority of the response.  A server can also
   use the header field as part of an HTTP request to communicate the
   correct or amended precedence to an intermediary.

   The systax of this header field is defined as follows.

   Priority           = 1#priority-directive
   priority-directive = token [ "=" ( token / quoted-string ) ]

2.1.  Priority Directives

2.1.1.  urgency

   Argument syntax:

   urgency = "blocking" / "document" / "non-blocking"

   The "urgency" directive indicates how a HTTP response affects the
   processing of other responses.

   o  "blocking" indicates that the response blocks the processing of
      others.

   o  "document" indicates that the response contains the document that
      is being processed.

   o  "non-blocking" indicates that the response does not block the
      processing of the document even though the response is being used
      or referred by the document.

   When the Priority header or the "urgency" directive do not appear in
   the request, the server SHOULD act as if urgency level of "document"
   was specified.

   A server SHOULD transmit HTTP responses that have the "blocking"
   attribute, then those with the "document" attribute, and finaly the
   ones with the "non-blocking" attribute.

   The following example shows a request for a CSS file with the urgency
   set to "blocking":

   GET /style.css HTTP/1.1
   Priority: urgency=blocking


2.1.2.  progressive

   Argument syntax:

   progressive = "yes" / "no"

   This boolean directive indicates if a response can be processed
   progressively, i.e. provide some meaningful output as chunks of the
   response arrive.

   When the Priority header field or the "progressive" directive do not
   appear in the request, the server SHOULD act as if a "progress"
   directive with an argument of "no" has specified.

   A server SHOULD distribute the bandwidth of a connection between the
   responses deemed progressive sharing the same urgency.

   The following examples shows a request for a JPEG file with the
   urgency set to "non-blocking", progressive set to "yes".

   GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1
   Priority: urgency=non-blocking, progressive=yes


2.2.  Merging Client- and Server-Driven Directives

   It is not always the case that the client has the best view of how
   the HTTP responses should be prioritized.  For example, whether a
   JPEG image should be served progressively by the server depends on

   the structure of that image file - a property only known to the
   server.

   Therefore, a server is permitted to send a "Priority" response header
   field.  When used, the directives found in this response header field
   overrides those specified by the client.

   For example, when the client sends a HTTP request with

   Priority: urgency=non-blocking; progressive=yes

   and the origin responds with

   Priority: progressive=no

   the intermediary's view of the progressiveness of the response
   becomes negative, because the server-provided value overrides that
   provided by the client.  The urgency is deemed as "non-blocking",
   because the server did not specify the directive.
