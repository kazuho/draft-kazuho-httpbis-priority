1.  Introduction

   It is often the case for the processing of an HTTP response to depend
   on the retrieval of another HTTP response.

   As an example, visual rendering of an HTML document could be blocked
   by the retrieval of a CSS file that the document refers to.  Inline
   images is another example, though the difference is that they
   typically do not block rendering.  Instead, they are rendered
   progressively as the chunks of the images arrive.

   To provide meaningful representation of a document at the earliest
   moment, it is important for a HTTP server to prioritize the HTTP
   responses, or the chunks of those HTTP responses, that it sends.

   HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) provides such prioritization scheme.  A client
   sends a series of PRIORITY frames to communicate to the server a
   "priority tree;" a tree that represents the client's preferred
   ordering and weighted distribution of the bandwidth among the HTTP
   responses.  However, the design has shortcomings:

   o  Its complexity has led to varying levels of support by the HTTP/2
      client and servers.

   o  It is hard to coordinate with server-driven prioritization.  For
      example, a server, with the knowledge of the document structure,
      might want to prioritize the delivery of images that are critical
      to user experience above others images, but below the CSS files.
      But with the HTTP/2 prioritization scheme, it is impossible for
      the server to determine how such images should be prioritized
      against other responses that use client-driven prioritization

      tree, because every client builds the HTTP/2 prioritization tree
      in a different way.

   o  It does not define a method that can be used by a server to
      express the priority of a response.  Without such a method,
      intermediaries cannot coordinate client-driven and server-driven
      priorities.

   o  The design cannot be ported cleanly to HTTP/3 ([QUIC-HTTP]).  One
      of the primary goals of HTTP/3 is to minimize head-of-line
      blocking.  Transmitting the evolving representation of a
      "prioritization tree" from the client to the server requires head-
      of-line blocking.

   Based on these observations, this document defines the Priority HTTP
   header field that can be used by both the client and the server to
   specify the precedence of HTTP responses in a standardized,
   extensible, protocol-version- independent, end-to-end representation.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Priority HTTP Header Field

   The Priority HTTP header field is used by a client as part of an HTTP
   request to specify the priority of the response.  A server can also
   use the header field as part of an HTTP request to communicate the
   correct or amended precedence to an intermediary.

   The systax of this header field is defined as follows.

   Priority           = 1#priority-directive
   priority-directive = token [ "=" ( token / quoted-string ) ]

2.1.  Priority Directives

2.1.1.  urgency

   Argument syntax:

   urgency = "blocking" / "document" / "non-blocking"

   The "urgency" directive indicates how a HTTP response affects the
   processing of other responses.

   o  "blocking" indicates that the response blocks the processing of
      others.

   o  "document" indicates that the response contains the document that
      is being processed.

   o  "non-blocking" indicates that the response does not block the
      processing of the document even though the response is being used
      or referred by the document.

   When the Priority header or the "urgency" directive do not appear in
   the request, the server SHOULD act as if urgency level of "document"
   was specified.

   A server SHOULD transmit HTTP responses that have the "blocking"
   attribute, then those with the "document" attribute, and finaly the
   ones with the "non-blocking" attribute.

   The following example shows a request for a CSS file with the urgency
   set to "blocking":

   GET /style.css HTTP/1.1
   Priority: urgency=blocking


2.1.2.  progressive

   Argument syntax:

   progressive = "yes" / "no"

   This boolean directive indicates if a response can be processed
   progressively, i.e. provide some meaningful output as chunks of the
   response arrive.

   When the Priority header field or the "progressive" directive do not
   appear in the request, the server SHOULD act as if a "progress"
   directive with an argument of "no" has specified.

   A server SHOULD distribute the bandwidth of a connection between the
   responses deemed progressive sharing the same urgency.

   The following examples shows a request for a JPEG file with the
   urgency set to "non-blocking", progressive set to "yes".

   GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1
   Priority: urgency=non-blocking, progressive=yes

2.2.  Merging Client- and Server-Driven Directives

   It is not always the case that the client has the best view of how
   the HTTP responses should be prioritized.  For example, whether a
   JPEG image should be served progressively by the server depends on
   the structure of that image file - a property only known to the
   server.

   Therefore, a server is permitted to send a "Priority" response header
   field.  When used, the directives found in this response header field
   overrides those specified by the client.

   For example, when the client sends a HTTP request with

   Priority: urgency=non-blocking; progressive=yes

   and the origin responds with

   Priority: progressive=no

   the intermediary's view of the progressiveness of the response
   becomes negative, because the server-provided value overrides that
   provided by the client.  The urgency is deemed as "non-blocking",
   because the server did not specify the directive.

3.  Coexistence with HTTP/2 Priorities

   When connecting to a HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) server, a client that uses
   this header-based prioritization scheme SHOULD send a
   "SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY" settings parameter (0xTBD) with a
   value of zero.  An intermediary SHOULD set the settings parameter for
   a connection it establishes when and only when all the requests to be
   sent over that connection originates from a client that utilizes this
   header-based prioritization scheme.

   The existence of this settings parameter instructs the server that
   recognizes the settings parameter to use the header-based
   prioritization scheme instead of the frame-based prioritization
   scheme defined by HTTP/2.  A server that does not recognize this
   settings parameter would respect the frame-based prioritization
   scheme.

4.  Security Considerations
